## WHAT IS DEMO VAULT?
Demo.Vault is a product that aims to curate digital artifacts for preservation, collection and reserach puposes. Our leading feature provides a gallery where users can mint demos from their favourite projects as NFTs. We consider this a way of showing appreciation to the creative process of developers who are the builders of our current digital age.

## WHY DEMO VAULT?
Our hypothesis is that demos are digital artifacts worth collecting because they underpin the very beginning of most social innovation especially in the tech space. Demo.vault will allow people to tap into the current digital revolution by allowing them collect demos of some of the most innovative products ever made as NFTs. 

## HOW IT'S MADE
Demo.Vault is currently bootstrapped using Liverpeer's framework, we have built ontop of their existing sdk solutions which allows for video streaming, uploading and minitng. This allows users to come to our page and mint their favourite demos immediately. 
All uploads have been done onto IPFS and deployed to FVM's Filecoin Calibration Testnet. Contract code is written in Solidity and the frontend is displayed using React and rendered using Next.js. Wallet's UX has been provided using RainbowKit and Wagmi

## WHO WILL FIND IT USEFUL?
1. Tech lovers: First of all, demo.vault pays homage to early buidlers. We consider buidlers, founders and entrepeneurs,creators in their own right and demos are their works of art. Demo.vault is how you and i appreaciate their work ethic and the innovative ideas being pushed out the world useful.
2. Developers: Devs can use the demos as NFTs to provide value for the lovers and followers of their project. This way when someone wants to tip them, they also get something in return
3. Founders: Founders who later find success with the project attached to their demos listed as NFTs can loop back to it to provide more value to their early lovers of their project, this could be in exchange for governance tokens, actual shares, etc.
   
*The future is what we make it, with demo.vault we are looking into the future, exploring the possibilities of what can be done with digital artifacts, i do not own a mona lisa, but maybe one day owning the first FVM demo might be worth a lot in the metaverse*
