# demo.vault

## WHAT IS DEMO VAULT?
Our product will allow folks to collect their favourite demos as NFTs via the *markeptlace* feature which is in itself is a way of supporting early builders of innovative products. Our additional feature is the *vault* function which we allow folks to preserve special 'nostaglic' demos live on-chain. 

## WHY DEMO VAULT?
Our hypothesis is that demos are digital artifacts worth collecting because they underpin the very beginning of most social innovation especially in the tech-sphere. Demo.vault will allow people to tap into the current digital revolution by allowing them collect demos of some of the most innovative products ever made as NFTs. 

**some demos are worth collecting as personal collector items, some are worth preserving on-chain like the ancient artifacts that represent key moments in mankind history**, Demo.vault will not just be a gallery-marketplace it will be a vault - true, to its name where our digital history is pereserved on-chain, free from erasure or censorship.

##HOW WILL IT BE USEFUL?
* First of all, demo.vault pays homage to early buidlers. We consider buidlers, founders and entrepeneurs,creators in their own right and demos are their works of art. Demo.vault is how you and i aprreaciate their work ethic and the innovative ideas being pushed out the world useful.
* When you buy a demo and collect it as NFT, you have invariably supported that 'hacker' that you loved their project, you encourage them to keep going.
* In turn, demo.vault can allow founders to appreciate collectors of their demos later in future.
* In the gaming world, where skins, weapons are often collected, *collected demos* offer a unique exploration into what we can do in future by owning it.

**with demo.vault we are looking into the future, exploring the possibilities of what can be done with digital artifacts, i do not own a mona lisa, but maybe one day owning the first Apple demo might be worth a lot in the metaverse**
