## WHAT IS DEMO VAULT?
Demo.Vault is a product that aims to curate digital artifacts for preservation, collection and reserach puposes. Our leading feature provides a gallery where users can mint demos from their favourite projects as NFTs. We consider this a way of showing appreciation to the creative process of developers who are the builders of our current digital age. 
We also have a work-in-progress encrypt vault feature that allows devs to upload important datasets like their versioned software, original source code, app transaction data, etc. With this feature devs can charge our customers to have access to important data or information that applies to how their app works for a fee.

## WHY DEMO VAULT?
Our hypothesis is that demos are digital artifacts worth collecting because they underpin the very beginning of most social innovation especially in the tech space. Demo.vault gallery will allow people to tap into the current digital revolution by allowing them collect demos of some of the most innovative products ever made as NFTs. With the vault feature we intend to build out a DAO which will ensure a circular economy where data is traded, curated and preserved for future use. All of this done in an accessible way focussed on the lovers and users of data.

## HOW IT'S MADE
Demo.Vault is currently bootstrapped using Liverpeer's framework, we have built on top of their existing sdk solutions which allows for video streaming, uploading and mintng. This allows users to come to our page and mint their favourite demos immediately. 
All uploads have been done on to IPFS and deployed to FVM's Filecoin Calibration Testnet. Contract code is written in Solidity and the frontend is displayed using React and rendered using Next.js. Wallet's UX has been provided using RainbowKit and Wagmi.
The vault feature is built on Spheron which handles the storage, encryption and decryption of datasets. The encryption and decryption itself is built on Lit protocol, both of these applications were integrated using their sdks. The datasets are decrypted and downloaded for a fee which is programmed via smart contract deployed to the FEVM network. 


## WHO WILL FIND IT USEFUL?
1. Tech lovers: First of all, demo.vault pays homage to early buidlers. We consider buidlers, founders and entrepeneurs,creators in their own right and demos are their works of art. Demo.vault is how you and i appreaciate their work ethic and the innovative ideas being pushed out the world useful.
2. Developers: Devs can use the demos as NFTs to provide value for the lovers and followers of their project. This way when someone wants to tip them, they also get something in return.
3. Founders: Founders who later find success with the project attached to their demos listed as NFTs can loop back to it to provide more value to their early lovers of their project, this could be in exchange for governance tokens, actual shares, etc.
   
*The future is what we make it, with demo.vault we are looking into the future, exploring the possibilities of what can be done with digital artifacts, i do not own a mona lisa, but maybe one day owning the first FVM demo might be worth a lot in the metaverse*
